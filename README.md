This library provides basic functionality for `xswag` applications and
libraries. It's mostly about pretty error messages and managing the source file. I'm not sure that this library is useful for general purpose use, because it was designed with the `xswag` in mind.

**Note:** While this project is alrady usable, it's still in its early days!
